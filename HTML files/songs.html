            <div class="text">Porter Robinson: Musician</div>
            
            <div class="thesis"><p>
                Musician is an interesting song in terms of it's effect on my life and place in my heart, and has changed drastically over time.
                Originally it was one of the songs that was released before the full album "Nurture" came out, in around 2020-2021~. However for me
                back then the song I had on repeat was Mirror, another song I am sure I will write plenty about. Musician is a song I wouldn't come to 
                love until November of 2023, when Porter Robinson came to play in Australia. The whole concert is something I will also probably go into
                detail of at some point but the biggest takeaway for me from it, was I finally GOT musician. It's a song that you have to FEEL his passion 
                into, and only works with someone who is clearly so genuine, and loves what he does. It's a culmination of the years of doubt, people telling
                him he can't make it, that Worlds was a fluke. And for years the thoughts got to him, there was 7 years before he started making music again.
                And while author's intent is interesting and all, for me, it's something I can feel so deeply about as well because for years I was embarassed
                about expressing my emotions, and passions. To this day it's something I still struggle with, but then I listen to this song, and I realise that
                that's half the joy of life. "I just can't stop I'm sorry", "But sincerly, can't you feel what I'm feeling?" is something I often wonder over
                the years when I have been faced with people who just seem incapable of caring, being genuine and vulnerable. It takes a lot to show that side 
                of you to people, and I have such huge respect for Porter as an artist who could have just continued to make probably decent electronic music
                but instead chose to take a risk and do something that honestly no other album has made me feel. The transition from worlds (his first album)
                to nurture is so much more than just 7 years, it's growth, change and honeslty just such a bright outlook on life that fills me with joy.
                And of all of those songs, Musician, at least for me right now gets me up in the morning and makes me smile, that it's alright to be passionate,
                to share that passion and joy in the world and to create!! (this is probably a bit rambly and a bit all over the place I think I will probably come
                back and compose my thoughts a bit more elegantly in future but this was just pure stream-of-conciousness) (second edit, idk I kind of like how aimless
                it comes across, maybe it's more genuine that way, and not everything has to be elegant, that being said, be warned reading ahead there is plenty more garbage!!)

            <div><p>
                Bodys. Well I have you to blame for this one. Upon first listen I thought it was pretty good, guitar definetly gave me stokes vibes
                but it wasn't until I really sat down to LISTEN to this song properly that I began to love it. The first few times through, and especially
                not knowing the lyrics it felt a bit scrambled and non-sensical, the lyrical structure and tonal shifts (ex-the quieter ad-lib feeling lines
                "is it the chorus yet?" and then the more passionate and forthcoming "Those are you got some nice shoulders") came off strange but again the 
                more I listened to it the more it sort of started to click for me. I suppose I should start with the lyrics, it addresses some primal fears 
                feelings that I have carried for so long, and never really had the words to express. I am terrified of death, as I'm sure many people are but
                it doesn't really hit home until you realise, out bodies COULD fall apart at any time, there isn't much keeping them together and every moment
                could be your last. The world isn't fair, you aren't above anything, and nobody owes you nothing. But there are two main ways I feel like you can
                interpret that idea. You can be nihlistic, nothing matters, so why bother doing anything? Why choose the high road? Why be a good person if it's 
                going to end the same way no matter what? Which for a long time was how I felt, it felt like I was pouring all this effort into doing "The right thing"
                for the sake of nothing. But recently, and honestly due in part to a lot of these songs it's taken on a new meaning. There is no meaning to life, time
                is precious and nothing matters. So do what makes you happy. Make your own meaning, and sometimes, "I'm sick of meaning, I just want to hold you". That 
                line struck me so deeply, as someone who thinks, and feels and MEANS all the time so deliberate and scared and risk averse my whole life I just want 
                someone to hold. I want something to take away the thinking, the feeling, the meaning and just to BE in the moment. I have a hard time letting go, but 
                this songs makes me want too. I think it's something have really realised recently. It's kind of hard for me to put into words still but the feeling is there.
                I also want to gush a little about the initial sing-songy talking bit at the start of the song? (I don't know the proper terminonlogy for music as is very apparent)
                The spoken word against himself "(But you can't sing (as far as I'm aware), though everyone can sing (as you are well aware))" it's like his thoughts are coming into 
                the forefront of his mind, I don't really have a super deep analysis of it I just really like the back and forth.
                And "I keep so quiet it's hard to tell I'm alive" hit me right in the feels. I used to do this all the time, much less now but I would just shut down sometimes and it
                felt like the only thing I could do is be so still that it was like I wasn't even really there. I might be missing the point but that's what it makes me think about
                and feel.

            <div class="text">The Cribs: Be Safe</div>
            <div><p>Be Safe, a song shown to me by one of my friends, upon looking initially it hits all of my favourite guilty pleasures. Needlessly edgy and long album name?
                    Check. Cool looking artwork on the cover, Check, alt sound, and interesting vocals and lyrics? Check, Check, Check. But then you actually listen to it.
                    It's not just needlessly edgy, it's not just trying to be cool, it sounds like random garbled jibberish thrown together but it isn't. It's a song I had to 
                    memorise as soon as I heard it, and I think a lot to do with it is in the delivery. The lyrics are like slam poetry? (I think I don't really know what slam
                    poetry is) where he sings the words, but it's with a certain, gravitas? (meaning: dignity, seriousness, or solemnity of manner.) that just makes the words HIT.
                    It's unique, it's powerful and driving late at night with the windows down and this cranked makes me want to slam my car into a tree at 450km/hr (in the best
                    way possible).

            <div class="text">Va-11 Hall-A Bonus Soundtrack: Shine Spark</div>
            <div><p>Ahhhh shine spark :D. This is a bit of a strange one in terms of tone and message, as most of the songs on here are mellow, or depressing or heavy,
                    Shine Spark is like a little ode to joy. I honestly don't know what it is about this song that made it click for me so much. And I suppose some background
                    is required to even understand what it is and why it exists. Va-11 Hall-A is one of my favourite games of all time, you play as a bartender in a futuristic
                    cyberpunk dystopia and serve drinks, that's it. However the writing, characters, art and especially music are just all so well done it's incredible. In the game
                    there is an in universe celebrity pop-singer known as Kira-Miki, who comes to the bar a couple of times, and has a couple of songs that you can buy. Shine Spark
                    is a bonus track that takes the song from the game and adds lyrics, mimicing a live performance from a Kira-Miki concert. The cheering crowd and sweeping atmosphere,
                    combined with of course the fantastic vocals and the sax solo??? like??? It has no right to be this good. For a silly little bonus song in a game already this good
                    idk man. This song manages to make me smile every time I hear it and I can't help but scream it at the top of my lungs every time it comes on, the positivity is 
                    infectious and it is definetly my like, happy anthem? I guess. It's awesome, Va-11 Hall-A is awesome, we should play it.

            <div class="text">Doki Doki Literature Club: Your Reality</div>
            <div><p>Your reality... Aside from being a gorgeous song this one just got so much harder... I first played doki doki when it came out ages ago,
                    only being told "trust it's good" and somehow made it through, it scared the ever living shit out of me as a 14 something year old, so by
                    the time the ending credits were rolling the last thing I was thinking about was the naunce and beauty of the ending credits song. However,
                    in years to come and through watching more than a few of my friends/youtubers/whatever play it and more importantly react/experience the game,
                    I have come to appreciate it dearly. I'll start with the song I guess, the writing, foreshadowing and monika's angelic voice are just divine. 
                    She has such a sweet and endearing voice, and the piano with the iconic doki doki melody are so brilliantly done, with such deep philisophical 
                    lines delivered so easily and heartfelt, "The ink flows down into a dark puddle" - referencing the line from the game, "What good are words when
                    a smile says it all?" - "Does my pen only write bitter words for those who are dear to me" AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. just. The implications from the game,
                    and furthermore of life in general and forming your own destiny. So cool man. But that alone would probably not be enough to get it on this list,
                    and especially not in the capacity I am about to write about it in. The last playthrough, with you. Paige I don't think words can eloquently enough
                    describe the rollercoaster of emotions I experienced. The tension, and unease through the first two hours at my house, watching you roll your eyes
                    and groan through, knowing that it would be so worth it, seeing the little hints being dropped in the poems and diologue and having to be silent. 
                    The days in between, sitting around, thinking about the game, and wanting so dearly to just leave work and go and play it and the hope that we could
                    find the time at halls gap so the thoughts could get out of my mind and I could finally make you understand, and talk to you about it!! And that fateful
                    night, where it was just the perfect intersection of sleep deprivation, drunkness and physical tiredness that for some reason I couldn't feel at all.
                    After so many emotions it was just. So blissful watching you play, freak out and experience all of the things I had been thinking about for days,
                    the way you trusted and embraced the game and gave it a genuine shot made me really really happy. I love sharing things that I love with people, and 
                    seeing it click with you was deeply satisfying, not to mention the late night chat, the screaming, the laughing, and just the flow of conversation being
                    so easy. so effortless. That memory, has this song playing in the back, and everytime I hear it it makes me smile.

            <div class="text">Persona 5 OST: Beneath the Mask (Rain arrange)</div>
            <div><p>Persona 5 and it's OST are one of the most special things to me, and most of all out of all the songs, is this one, specifically the rainy version.
                    For some reason I love rain in songs, I love the rain in general, it's such a calming and reasurring sound and it fits so well with this track. I'll
                    start with my love of the song, and then it's importance in my life, The lyrics, vocals and mellow tones in this track as many of the previous ones did
                    just hit me straight in the feels man, it's such a reassuring song, and describes a lot of things that I thought a lot about when I was younger. Of the 
                    ancient japanese proverb about the three masks, One, you show to everyone, one, you show to your friends and family, and the other, only to yourself. I 
                    often wonder about how much truth there is to that, and what constitues the "real" version of yourself. This song isn't nessecarily about that, for me, 
                    it's about lonliness, having to hide behind your mask, for safety, for comfort, being unable to open yourself up, be vulnerable. "I'm a shapeshifter, 
                    what else shoudl I be?". "Please don't take off my mask. Revealing Dark." I struggle, and struggled a lot to be myself, and to be genuine, it's kind of 
                    easy to see why. Trying to talk to people in high school, outside of my immedate friend group would often result in them being confused and uninterested. 
                    Very few people throughout my life can tolerate the yappage. Which is totally fair, it is a lot, and for people who don't know or don't care to know what I'm
                    talking about shouldn't have to. However, this did lead to me being a very quiet and introverted person for most of my life, even still. In an unfamiliar 
                    environment I am so bad at talking to people, better certainly than I was years ago, maybe due to working and being forced into social situations but 
                    I still feel so much more comfortable in familiar environments with people I know I can just be myself around. Aside from the songs meaning I also just love
                    Persona 5, Persona 5 was a game that could not have come at a better time in my life, when I was struggling with my own real life friends and feeling more isolated
                    than perhaps any other time in my life that I can recall. Persona 5 was a stand in for friends, for interaction. It made me feel wanted and needed, the connections
                    that you build in that game were the only things that brought me any joy around that time, because I could always count on booting up the game and them being there.
                    It's sad in retrospect, and not a healthy way to engage but I think it's because of that why I hold it so dear to me, and why I always find myself coming back to
                    beneath the mask.

            <div class="text">Mellow Fellow: Dancing</div>
            <div><p>Mellow Fellow is an artist I stumbled upon by chance, I can't remember which of his songs came on but one of them was autoplayed by spotify
                    and for all the shit I will give it, on occasion spotify does hit the mark with me, this being one of those occasions. Dancing captures a feeling
                    of nostalgia and longing so strongly I haven't even experienced it yet and it still makes me feel. Well that's not entirely true, in some capacity
                    the longing and wanting is something I can at some level interface with, "Maybe that day, I'll be, I'll be". Wanting to be that person for someone,
                    wanting to just be with them in the moment. But what this song I think most makes me think about is the future, missed opportunities, or just things 
                    that weren't meant to be. "Years ago, when I had a chance", "I could have held your hand..," I'm taking some liberties with the punctuation here but 
                    bear with me, it's the most accurate way I can think to type the way that he sings those lines. They trail off, like there is a little twinge of regret.
                    "I blew every single circumstance". It's something that I fear greatly, That I've done, both in trying and failing and also the regret of not trying at all.
                    I think the worst part isn't all of that though, it's dealing with the thoughts afterwards. The thoughts of inadequacy, questioning what was wrong with me?
                    What did I do wrong? Because as much as I like to believe that things just happen, things do happen for a reason, I am inadequate. And all I can do about it
                    is move on and try and make myself the best version that I can be. No-one is perfect, some are just less imperfect than others.
