            <div class="text">Porter Robinson: Musician</div>
            
            <div class="thesis"><p>
                Musician is an interesting song in terms of it's effect on my life and place in my heart, and has changed drastically over time.
                Originally it was one of the songs that was released before the full album "Nurture" came out, in around 2020-2021~. However for me
                back then the song I had on repeat was Mirror, another song I am sure I will write plenty about. Musician is a song I wouldn't come to 
                love until November of 2023, when Porter Robinson came to play in Australia. The whole concert is something I will also probably go into
                detail of at some point but the biggest takeaway for me from it, was I finally GOT musician. It's a song that you have to FEEL his passion 
                into, and only works with someone who is clearly so genuine, and loves what he does. It's a culmination of the years of doubt, people telling
                him he can't make it, that Worlds was a fluke. And for years the thoughts got to him, there was 7 years before he started making music again.
                And while author's intent is interesting and all, for me, it's something I can feel so deeply about as well because for years I was embarassed
                about expressing my emotions, and passions. To this day it's something I still struggle with, but then I listen to this song, and I realise that
                that's half the joy of life. "I just can't stop I'm sorry", "But sincerly, can't you feel what I'm feeling?" is something I often wonder over
                the years when I have been faced with people who just seem incapable of caring, being genuine and vulnerable. It takes a lot to show that side 
                of you to people, and I have such huge respect for Porter as an artist who could have just continued to make probably decent electronic music
                but instead chose to take a risk and do something that honestly no other album has made me feel. The transition from worlds (his first album)
                to nurture is so much more than just 7 years, it's growth, change and honeslty just such a bright outlook on life that fills me with joy.
                And of all of those songs, Musician, at least for me right now gets me up in the morning and makes me smile, that it's alright to be passionate,
                to share that passion and joy in the world and to create!! (this is probably a bit rambly and a bit all over the place I think I will probably come
                back and compose my thoughts a bit more elegantly in future but this was just pure stream-of-conciousness) (second edit, idk I kind of like how aimless
                it comes across, maybe it's more genuine that way, and not everything has to be elegant, that being said, be warned reading ahead there is plenty more garbage!!)

            <div class="text">Car Seat Headrest: Bodys</div>
            <div><p>
                Bodys. Well I have you to blame for this one. Upon first listen I thought it was pretty good, guitar definetly gave me stokes vibes
                but it wasn't until I really sat down to LISTEN to this song properly that I began to love it. The first few times through, and especially
                not knowing the lyrics it felt a bit scrambled and non-sensical, the lyrical structure and tonal shifts (ex-the quieter ad-lib feeling lines
                "is it the chorus yet?" and then the more passionate and forthcoming "Those are you got some nice shoulders") came off strange but again the 
                more I listened to it the more it sort of started to click for me. I suppose I should start with the lyrics, it addresses some primal fears 
                feelings that I have carried for so long, and never really had the words to express. I am terrified of death, as I'm sure many people are but
                it doesn't really hit home until you realise, out bodies COULD fall apart at any time, there isn't much keeping them together and every moment
                could be your last. The world isn't fair, you aren't above anything, and nobody owes you nothing. But there are two main ways I feel like you can
                interpret that idea. You can be nihlistic, nothing matters, so why bother doing anything? Why choose the high road? Why be a good person if it's 
                going to end the same way no matter what? Which for a long time was how I felt, it felt like I was pouring all this effort into doing "The right thing"
                for the sake of nothing. But recently, and honestly due in part to a lot of these songs it's taken on a new meaning. There is no meaning to life, time
                is precious and nothing matters. So do what makes you happy. Make your own meaning, and sometimes, "I'm sick of meaning, I just want to hold you". That 
                line struck me so deeply, as someone who thinks, and feels and MEANS all the time so deliberate and scared and risk averse my whole life I just want 
                someone to hold. I want something to take away the thinking, the feeling, the meaning and just to BE in the moment. I have a hard time letting go, but 
                this songs makes me want too. I think it's something have really realised recently. It's kind of hard for me to put into words still but the feeling is there.
                I also want to gush a little about the initial sing-songy talking bit at the start of the song? (I don't know the proper terminonlogy for music as is very apparent)
                The spoken word against himself "(But you can't sing (as far as I'm aware), though everyone can sing (as you are well aware))" it's like his thoughts are coming into 
                the forefront of his mind, I don't really have a super deep analysis of it I just really like the back and forth.
                And "I keep so quiet it's hard to tell I'm alive" hit me right in the feels. I used to do this all the time, much less now but I would just shut down sometimes and it
                felt like the only thing I could do is be so still that it was like I wasn't even really there. I might be missing the point but that's what it makes me think about
                and feel.

            <div class="text">The Cribs: Be Safe</div>
            <div><p>Be Safe, a song shown to me by one of my friends, upon looking initially it hits all of my favourite guilty pleasures. Needlessly edgy and long album name?
                    Check. Cool looking artwork on the cover, Check, alt sound, and interesting vocals and lyrics? Check, Check, Check. But then you actually listen to it.
                    It's not just needlessly edgy, it's not just trying to be cool, it sounds like random garbled jibberish thrown together but it isn't. It's a song I had to 
                    memorise as soon as I heard it, and I think a lot to do with it is in the delivery. The lyrics are like slam poetry? (I think I don't really know what slam
                    poetry is) where he sings the words, but it's with a certain, gravitas? (meaning: dignity, seriousness, or solemnity of manner.) that just makes the words HIT.
                    It's unique, it's powerful and driving late at night with the windows down and this cranked makes me want to slam my car into a tree at 450km/hr (in the best
                    way possible).

            <div class="text">Va-11 Hall-A Bonus Soundtrack: Shine Spark</div>
            <div><p>Ahhhh shine spark :D. This is a bit of a strange one in terms of tone and message, as most of the songs on here are mellow, or depressing or heavy,
                    Shine Spark is like a little ode to joy. I honestly don't know what it is about this song that made it click for me so much. And I suppose some background
                    is required to even understand what it is and why it exists. Va-11 Hall-A is one of my favourite games of all time, you play as a bartender in a futuristic
                    cyberpunk dystopia and serve drinks, that's it. However the writing, characters, art and especially music are just all so well done it's incredible. In the game
                    there is an in universe celebrity pop-singer known as Kira-Miki, who comes to the bar a couple of times, and has a couple of songs that you can buy. Shine Spark
                    is a bonus track that takes the song from the game and adds lyrics, mimicing a live performance from a Kira-Miki concert. The cheering crowd and sweeping atmosphere,
                    combined with of course the fantastic vocals and the sax solo??? like??? It has no right to be this good. For a silly little bonus song in a game already this good
                    idk man. This song manages to make me smile every time I hear it and I can't help but scream it at the top of my lungs every time it comes on, the positivity is 
                    infectious and it is definetly my like, happy anthem? I guess. It's awesome, Va-11 Hall-A is awesome, we should play it.

            <div class="text">Doki Doki Literature Club: Your Reality</div>
            <div><p>Your reality... Aside from being a gorgeous song this one just got so much harder... I first played doki doki when it came out ages ago,
                    only being told "trust it's good" and somehow made it through, it scared the ever living shit out of me as a 14 something year old, so by
                    the time the ending credits were rolling the last thing I was thinking about was the naunce and beauty of the ending credits song. However,
                    in years to come and through watching more than a few of my friends/youtubers/whatever play it and more importantly react/experience the game,
                    I have come to appreciate it dearly. I'll start with the song I guess, the writing, foreshadowing and monika's angelic voice are just divine. 
                    She has such a sweet and endearing voice, and the piano with the iconic doki doki melody are so brilliantly done, with such deep philisophical 
                    lines delivered so easily and heartfelt, "The ink flows down into a dark puddle" - referencing the line from the game, "What good are words when
                    a smile says it all?" - "Does my pen only write bitter words for those who are dear to me" AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. just. The implications from the game,
                    and furthermore of life in general and forming your own destiny. So cool man. But that alone would probably not be enough to get it on this list,
                    and especially not in the capacity I am about to write about it in. The last playthrough, with you. Paige I don't think words can eloquently enough
                    describe the rollercoaster of emotions I experienced. The tension, and unease through the first two hours at my house, watching you roll your eyes
                    and groan through, knowing that it would be so worth it, seeing the little hints being dropped in the poems and diologue and having to be silent. 
                    The days in between, sitting around, thinking about the game, and wanting so dearly to just leave work and go and play it and the hope that we could
                    find the time at halls gap so the thoughts could get out of my mind and I could finally make you understand, and talk to you about it!! And that fateful
                    night, where it was just the perfect intersection of sleep deprivation, drunkness and physical tiredness that for some reason I couldn't feel at all.
                    After so many emotions it was just. So blissful watching you play, freak out and experience all of the things I had been thinking about for days,
                    the way you trusted and embraced the game and gave it a genuine shot made me really really happy. I love sharing things that I love with people, and 
                    seeing it click with you was deeply satisfying, not to mention the late night chat, the screaming, the laughing, and just the flow of conversation being
                    so easy. so effortless. That memory, has this song playing in the back, and everytime I hear it it makes me smile.

            <div class="text">Persona 5 OST: Beneath the Mask (Rain arrange)</div>
            <div><p>Persona 5 and it's OST are one of the most special things to me, and most of all out of all the songs, is this one, specifically the rainy version.
                    For some reason I love rain in songs, I love the rain in general, it's such a calming and reasurring sound and it fits so well with this track. I'll
                    start with my love of the song, and then it's importance in my life, The lyrics, vocals and mellow tones in this track as many of the previous ones did
                    just hit me straight in the feels man, it's such a reassuring song, and describes a lot of things that I thought a lot about when I was younger. Of the 
                    ancient japanese proverb about the three masks, One, you show to everyone, one, you show to your friends and family, and the other, only to yourself. I 
                    often wonder about how much truth there is to that, and what constitues the "real" version of yourself. This song isn't nessecarily about that, for me, 
                    it's about lonliness, having to hide behind your mask, for safety, for comfort, being unable to open yourself up, be vulnerable. "I'm a shapeshifter, 
                    what else shoudl I be?". "Please don't take off my mask. Revealing Dark." I struggle, and struggled a lot to be myself, and to be genuine, it's kind of 
                    easy to see why. Trying to talk to people in high school, outside of my immedate friend group would often result in them being confused and uninterested. 
                    Very few people throughout my life can tolerate the yappage. Which is totally fair, it is a lot, and for people who don't know or don't care to know what I'm
                    talking about shouldn't have to. However, this did lead to me being a very quiet and introverted person for most of my life, even still. In an unfamiliar 
                    environment I am so bad at talking to people, better certainly than I was years ago, maybe due to working and being forced into social situations but 
                    I still feel so much more comfortable in familiar environments with people I know I can just be myself around. Aside from the songs meaning I also just love
                    Persona 5, Persona 5 was a game that could not have come at a better time in my life, when I was struggling with my own real life friends and feeling more isolated
                    than perhaps any other time in my life that I can recall. Persona 5 was a stand in for friends, for interaction. It made me feel wanted and needed, the connections
                    that you build in that game were the only things that brought me any joy around that time, because I could always count on booting up the game and them being there.
                    It's sad in retrospect, and not a healthy way to engage but I think it's because of that why I hold it so dear to me, and why I always find myself coming back to
                    beneath the mask.

            <div class="text">Mellow Fellow: Dancing</div>
            <div><p>Mellow Fellow is an artist I stumbled upon by chance, I can't remember which of his songs came on but one of them was autoplayed by spotify
                    and for all the shit I will give it, on occasion spotify does hit the mark with me, this being one of those occasions. Dancing captures a feeling
                    of nostalgia and longing so strongly I haven't even experienced it yet and it still makes me feel. Well that's not entirely true, in some capacity
                    the longing and wanting is something I can at some level interface with, "Maybe that day, I'll be, I'll be". Wanting to be that person for someone,
                    wanting to just be with them in the moment. But what this song I think most makes me think about is the future, missed opportunities, or just things 
                    that weren't meant to be. "Years ago, when I had a chance", "I could have held your hand..," I'm taking some liberties with the punctuation here but 
                    bear with me, it's the most accurate way I can think to type the way that he sings those lines. They trail off, like there is a little twinge of regret.
                    "I blew every single circumstance". It's something that I fear greatly, That I've done, both in trying and failing and also the regret of not trying at all.
                    I think the worst part isn't all of that though, it's dealing with the thoughts afterwards. The thoughts of inadequacy, questioning what was wrong with me?
                    What did I do wrong? Because as much as I like to believe that things just happen, things do happen for a reason, I am inadequate. And all I can do about it
                    is move on and try and make myself the best version that I can be. No-one is perfect, some are just less imperfect than others.

            <div class="text">Not a song! Just a bit of a yap</div>
            <div><p>I figure this is as good a place as any to put this!! I'm not particularly sure how to structure this either, so expect a bit of confusion.
                    I suppose a good place to start as any, I have been reading a bit about nature vs nurture!! Apparently in like, 2015 I think? an emerging field 
                    of science (biology/psychology??) called epigenetics started being studied and can somewhat speak to and explain a likely scenario of nature vs nurture
                    in people. The way that I understand it, is that people have epigenomes, which are sort of like your baked in characteristics, most likely passed down to
                    you from your parents and whatnot. That part is the nature, however, factors in your upbringing can shape how these epigenomes activate or how they do.
                    Now this is all purely theoretical (according to my VERY brief research) in terms of people because of a few reasons. Firstly, it's a huge ethical issue
                    to run experiments that would include controlling negative/positive stimuli throughout someones childhood to research the effects, but even still there 
                    isn't really a way to do it, because even during the 9 months in a mothers womb this epigenomes and experiences are being shaped and there is no way to 
                    control or monitor the effects that they are having. As such, the knowledge we have gained has come from a series of experiments with rats, in which rats
                    that were raised by more affectionate parents, no matter their birth epigenomes were less stressed even when put in mildly stressful situations as adults. 
                    There have also apparently been a couple of studies on primates that also mirror these findings, making it quite likely that something similar is true for 
                    people. "But Michael," I can hear you saying, "what the fuck does this actually mean in terms of nature vs nurture", well. I am so glad you asked that peg!!
                    It means both !!! Nature AND nurture are intertwined, asking the question of which is more important doesn't work because they are both essential. The metaphor
                    I read for this was, it's like asking what's more important for a car to run, an engine or spark plugs? One isn't more IMPORTANT than the other, but both are 
                    REQUIRED to make the car run in the first place. People may have epigenomes by NATURE, but the way that they are raised, influenced and what characteristics
                    they have are entirely changable by NURTURE. It means that there is a higher chance, and it MAY be a real thing in people that you have "Decendent epigenomes"
                    meaning you inherit these traits directly from your parents, but that is something we will (probably?) not be able to test for or know. Either way I thought
                    that was SUPER cool, and explains a lot. To put it in more specific terms, for the effect that it has on like me and you, (well, I only speak for myself so me)
                    I certainly feel like I take traits from both my mum and dad pretty heavily, that being stuff like being sensitive, but still capable of flipping out and being 
                    unreasonable, but also very clear deviations and influence from my childhood. I think my open-minded nature comes from a place of being taught to just respect
                    and be cordial (not the drink, the term for being friendly? sort of) with everyone regardless of status is something that was deeply instilled in my mum, as was
                    in me because she taught it to me from a young age. And that's something where even my Nana the other day came over and said "I don't give a rats who you are I
                    treat everyone the same". But to the same credit, my emotional un?intelligence, I couldn't think of a better way to phrase that was also certainly due to a lack
                    of both NATURE and NURTURE, basically locking in the epigenome that said you will bottle your feelings and not deal with them properly. At the end of the day, 
                    I find it to be reasurring that there is at least some sort of correlation to say, that you are at least SOMEWHAT in control of the person you become, because 
                    yes, while you are also a product of your environment, I believe EVERY person has the power to become whoever they want. It may be harder, it may be a consequence
                    of who influences them, but it is possible. And that's a cool thing I suppose to think about us now as well, even as we grow into adults, we have the power to 
                    influence and change others, to create more positivity, and happiness and inclusiveness in the world as I think I have even through the past couple of years. :D
                    But yeah I also think that sort of explains a lot about why some people are complacent, and just happy. They likely had parents the same, likely got passed down
                    the epigenome and then had it reinforced by their upbringing, essentially locking in how they are going to be as a person. The difficult thing is what went differently
                    for us? And unfortunately to that end, I don't really know. I'd love to know what you think because honestly I am at a bit of a loss for this one, maybe it was the 
                    independance, maybe it was the influence and freedom of having unrestricted internet access at a young age? but honestly yeah I don't really think I can say with
                    any certainty that it was any of those things.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    Maturity and age - This is one that isn't going to be as nuanced or based in fact or science. Just sort of what I am feeling. I always associated maturity with
                    experience and age, but honestly I don't think this is right anymore. I've been thinking about a couple of things, you asked me when we were standing on that 
                    playground in Omeo if I thought any differently becuase of our age gap, but what I've realised is that age has (not nothing) but little to do with maturity.
                    Maturity comes from a persons ability to be self aware- to have a strong idea of what is right and wrong and acknowledge that they have been wrong, to be able to 
                    be humble, and do things that aren't easy, that aren't comfortable because it is the "right" thing to do. And that's something that comes with experience. To be 
                    mature, you have to have been a shit-head at some point. I think it's just who can actually sit, and reckognise that they should be better. I don't know what it 
                    is that makes some people able to do this or not, but the reason I think age plays a part is because we are constantly growing, becoming better people. For the 
                    record I don't think I'm a saint, I have immature thoughts all the time, but again like you have said to me before, everyone has these thoughts (I assume), the 
                    important thing is what you choose to act on. And honestly I have met some people twice our age, hell I even had a probably like 70-80 year old lady at work that 
                    was 100x more immature than you are. I think it's all a case of experience, and self-awareness

                    <br><br>

                    Another thing is how you described the way you percieve your memories, in particlar, the distinction between how you may feel about something in retrospect,
                    but not letting that cloud how you felt at the time, and acknowledging that those two feelings may be WILDLY different, but shouldn't invalidate the feelings
                    you had at the time. I felt like that's such an interesting and good way of looking at things, that yeah, there may be negative emotions assosiated with the 
                    pain you eventually had to feel, the sadness that followed, but what is more important than that is holding on to the happiness, the joy, the love you felt at 
                    the time because at that point that was real. And it's not fair to take that away because of how you feel now. It's a really tough thing for me to conceptualise
                    because I've always just let the bitterness of the present cloud my judgement. But it's never really that simple, is it? Bad people can still produce some of the 
                    best times, and bad isn't a good word for it because I don't believe that people are just "good" or "bad", just that they make decisions and have aspects of them 
                    that can make them better or worse to be around. But being able to see moments for what they were, is a really special thing. Being able to perserve people or moments
                    in your life as they were I think is a really fantastic thing. It's hard to do, for sure it's hard to do but it's something that I want to be able to do moving forward.
                    Everything will eventually come to an end, all we can ever do is live in the moment, and even when looking to the past remember the moment, not the conclusion.

                    <br><br>

                    I did write a whole thing here, but I think this one is better left for a real conversation, I also don't honeslty know how or what to phrase it D:

                    <br><br>

                    I also had for the first time in a really long time a super restless night. It was strange, I had a long day, I should have been tired, but I just couldn't sleep.
                    I sat in my bed staring at the ceiling and listening to music, as I used to all the time, letting my mind wander which is not a good idea, as I'm sure you are aware.
                    But it led to a couple of things. One I'll expand on in the next page, I went back to an album I loved a couple years ago and reconnected with a song I now feel I 
                    understand a lot better. And if you wish to hear about that you can click over to the next page I'll jump into it a little more there. But one of the other things 
                    floating around my mind were all of the stuff I've talked about here, I didn't want to get up and write it down at the time because I really needed to go to sleep
                    because I had work at piss early o clock the next morning, but I think it's nice being able to organise my thoughts more clearly, and get them out of my head by 
                    putting them into here. Bonus points if you get anything out of this. Doesn't at all compare to talking to you, but you give me so much to think about, broaden my 
                    perspective on life so much man, it's really cool. I wish I could do it justice, that I could be good enough at writing or speaking for that matter to properly convey
                    my thoughts but this is the best we can get for now. Anyway, I'm rambling. Thanks for reading &lt3

            <div class="text">Bakers Eddy: 21</div>
            <div><p>
                
                Love Bordem Bicycles is an album I adore, I was there when it was released, I have the signed copy of the CD from that day, seeing Bakers Eddy perform is a treat.
                They have such a stage presence and I HIGHLY reccomend that you listen to both the youtube video version of this song as well as the one on streaming services if 
                you can because the live one conveys the emotion a lot better imo, whereas the streamed version is highly quality, more clear and overall a better listening experience.
                Anyway, why am I talking about this 2 year old song all of a sudden? Well. it's a stupid reason but I went back to it because I'm well.... 21. I memorised the lyrics
                years ago and I was thinking about them and how my outlook on life and perspective may have changed, which they certainly have a lot, and well. This song meant a lot 
                more to me now. Funny enough "My god can you believe I've just turned 21" hits harder when... it's true?? But the big one for me was "My god, two years passed and now
                I'm 23. But I'm still sat here wondering who the fuck I'm supposed to be, I don't know what that means or what the hell it's all about." Because if there's anything I've
                learnt in the past couple of years, and honestly in the last couple of months, it's how little I know. About myself, about other people, thinking that people had their shit
                sorted. No one has their shit sorted. But that isn't a scary thing, you know? I mean well of course it is but you just have to be able to live not knowing everything, you can't.
                He took the thoughts from my mind, "I've got bills to pay but still no life plans, And I'm sure it'll be alright." It will be alright. What am I gonna be when I'm 23? Fucked if 
                I know man. Fucked if I know what/where/who/how I'm going to be 6 months from now. But again, I think that isn't something to fear, the worst thing I think we can do is to
                let the fear paralyse us, and it isn't an easy thing to do but you just kind of have to trust that everything will work out alright, haha this is why some people rely on religion.
                But not being able to fit into that camp, you have to make your own meaning, and reason for being. And as scared as I am, so is everyone else, if they can do it, I'm sure as hell
                I can too. Whatever may come. This is a great album. I really hope we get the chance to see them perform it again, it really is a treat.
